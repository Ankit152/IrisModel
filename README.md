**Abstract:** Famous database from Fisher, 1936

* Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate
* Number of Instances: 150
* Area: Life
* Attribute Characteristics: Real
* Number of Attributes: 4
* Missing Values: No

**Data Set Information:** This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.

**Attribute Information:**

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
    * Iris Setosa
    * Iris Versicolour
    * Iris Virginica
